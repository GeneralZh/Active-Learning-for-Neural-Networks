# Active-Learning-for-Neural-Networks
This re-implemented the "EGL-word" method proposed in AAAI 2017 paper "Active Discriminative Text Representation Learning" in Tensorflow (the original implementation was in Theano). It compared three active learning methods "random", "entropy" and "EGL" on a sentiment analysis dataset.
